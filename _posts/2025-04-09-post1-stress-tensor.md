Stress Vector
---------------------
Most readers are already familiar with the well-known cube that illustrates the stress components. However, this cube is not a physical block of material extracted from the body; rather, it is a convenient representation of the stress field at a point, depicted using three mutually perpendicular planes defined by the base vectors (e1, e2, e3).

Due to static equilibrium conditions and the absence of body torques, the stress tensor is both real-symmetric. This symmetry ensures that the moments acting on an infinitesimal element are balanced.

According to Cauchy's stress theorem, if the stress tensor field at a point is known, its stress vector in a plane defined by normal vector {n} can be calculated with the projection of tensor field on the plane.

The stress vector on a cross-section is referred to as the traction vector, {T}. It is defined as the force vector acting on a cross-section divided by the area. The traction vector generally has both normal and tangential components with respect to the plane; in other words, it is not necessarily aligned with the normal vector.
