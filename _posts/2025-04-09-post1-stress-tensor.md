The stress tensor and its properties provide an ideal starting point for an engineering blog focused on solid mechanics. A solid understanding of this tensor facilitates comprehension of concepts such as coordinate transformation, principal stress, and yield criteria. Most readers are already familiar with the well-known cube that illustrates the stress components. However, this cube is not a physical block of material extracted from the body; rather, it is a convenient representation of the stress field at a point, depicted using three mutually perpendicular planes defined by the base vectors (e1, e2, e3).
